### 👨‍🎓 About me 

👨‍💻 Hello, my name is Thibaut Dejean and I am currently attending engineering school at École Centrale de Lyon. My courses are particularly focused on Machine Learning, computer development, and bio-engineering.

🅿️ During my 1st year, I participated in the creation of a website called "Trouve Ta Place" which allows Lyon drivers to find parking spaces in the urban area and to get there based on real-time occupancy data from Lyon's car parks and traffic.

✈️ During my 2nd year, I participated in a project to automate the military messaging system of the Air Base 942 of the French Air Force, aiming to facilitate the work of operators monitoring French air traffic.

🧠 Currently, I am interning for a duration of 6 months at the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center (CRNL). The objective of this internship is to develop a method based on deep learning (specifically CNNs and GCNs) to detect markers of epilepsy in magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of patients.
