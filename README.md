### 👨‍🎓 About me 

👨‍💻 Hello, my name is Thibaut Dejean and I am currently attending engineering school at École Centrale de Lyon. My courses are particularly focused on Machine Learning, computer development, and bio-engineering.

🅿️ During my 1st year, I participated in the creation of a website called "Trouve Ta Place" which allows Lyon drivers to find parking spaces in the urban area and to get there based on real-time occupancy data from Lyon's car parks and traffic.

✈️ During my 2nd year, I participated in a project to automate the military messaging system of the Air Base 942 of the French Air Force, aiming to facilitate the work of operators monitoring French air traffic.

🧠 During my gap year, I interned for six months at the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center (CRNL). The objective of this internship was to develop deep learning models, specifically CNNs and GCNs, to detect markers of epilepsy in magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings from patients. 

:dna: Currently, I am an intern at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where I'm working on fine-tuning and developing Protein Language Models (PLMs).
